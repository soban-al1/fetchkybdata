This repository has two main demos for Parsing data from public domains for KYB
1. a Demo python script which is a more traditional parsing.
this script takes a name of the legal entity and then finds all information you it finds on the web. Right now it is configured to check SGX and BursaMalaysia websites. This can be extended to find latest news or posts, giving it date/s as a parameter

2. A GPT - Lim the auditor - who is configured to find information about legal entities or individuals and then also identify their relationships which can be useful for KYB and KYC. This GPT also gives references for a compliance officer to double verify on whats going on. this is a basic GPT still to be used for Demo purposes. It can easily be configured more to also produce outcome in a certain way or can be connected in any workflow with APIs or direct interface integrations(e.g. with Cline)
